# RockbusterStealthLLCProject
Achievement 3 of CareerFoundry's curriculum, which calls to use SQL to solve business questions for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictional movie rental company.

The "Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project" asks students to imagine they are a data analyst in the business intelligence department. As an analyst in the business intelligence department, the data analysis student is asked to provide inventory/customer insights with SQL after loading the company's data into the relational database management system. 

Key questions include: Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?; What was the average rental duration for all videos?; Which customers are Rockbuster companies based in?; Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?; Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
 
Project deliverables: a presentation for business managers, documentation in Excel for technical colleagues, a data dictionary for technical colleagues.
